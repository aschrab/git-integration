git-integration
===============

This script helps you manage integration branches, which are a way of pulling
together in-flight topics to run the result for testing.

Say you are developing several new features on the branches 'feature-a',
'feature-b' and 'feature-c', while ongoing development is also happening on
the 'master' branch.  Using 'git integration' you can view the result of
merging all of the feature branches into 'master' and keep that branch updated
as all of these branches change.

See link:git-integration.txt for a full description.

Install
-------

Run 'make install', which will install the script into your '~/bin/'
directory.  You can customize the installation location by creating the file
'config.mak' with the contents:

    prefix = /usr/local

If you want to install the documentation you will need to have AsciiDoc[1]
installed, then run 'make install-doc'.
