Run 'make install', which will install the script into your '~/bin/'
directory.  You can customize the installation location by creating the file
'config.mak' with the contents:

    prefix = /usr/local

If you want to install the documentation you will need to have
link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] installed, then run
'make install-doc'.
