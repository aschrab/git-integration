Run `make install`, which will install the script into your `~/bin/`
directory.  You can customize the installation location by creating the file
`config.mak` with the contents:

    prefix = /usr/local

Make sure that the `bin` directory into which you install `git-integration` is
on your 'PATH'.

If you want to install the documentation you will need to have
link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] installed, then run
`make install-doc`.

To install the Bash completion script, run `make install-completion`, you may
then need to amend your Bash profile to load this script.  `git-integration`'s
completion script depends on the completion for Git being available.

To run the tests, you must initialize the
link:http://mlafeldt.github.com/sharness[Sharness] submodule:

    git submodule update --init

then run `make test`.
