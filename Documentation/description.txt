Use 'git integration' to manage a branch which is the result of merging
several in-progress topic branches onto a base branch.

Say you are developing several new features on the branches 'feature-a',
'feature-b' and 'feature-c', while ongoing development is also happening on
the 'master' branch.  Using 'git integration' you can view the result of
merging all of the feature branches into 'master' and keep that branch updated
as all of these branches change.

So you start with the following:

    o---o master
        |\
        | o---o feature-a
         \
          o---o feature-b

when you create an integration branch including 'feature-a' and 'feature-b':

    git integration --create integration master
    git integration --edit

edit the instruction sheet to look like:
------
base master
merge feature-a
merge feature-b
------
then rebuild:

    git integration --rebuild

the result will be:

    o---o master
        |\
        | o---o feature-a
        |\     \
        | ------o---o integration
         \         /
          o---o---- feature-b

should further development then happen on 'master', rebuilding the integration
branch:

    git integration --rebuild integration

will give the following result:

    o---o---o---o master
        |        \
        |       --o---o integration
        |\     /     /
        | o---o     /  feature-a
         \         /
          o---o---- feature-b
