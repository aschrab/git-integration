NAME
----
git-integration - Manage integration branches in Git

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git integration' --create <name> [<base>]
'git integration' [--edit] [--rebuild] [<branch>]
'git integration' --continue | --abort

DESCRIPTION
-----------
include::description.txt[]

OPTIONS
-------
--create::
	Create a new integration branch.  If '--edit' is also specified then
	the instruction sheet will be opened for editing.  If '--rebuild' is
	also specified then the branch will be built.
+
The name of the integration branch must be specified.  If a second positional
argument is specified then it is used as the base branch, otherwise ``master''
will be used.

--edit::
	Edit the instruction sheet for an integration branch.
+
If no branch name is specified then the current branch must be an existing
integration branch.

--rebuild::
--no-rebuild::
	Rebuild the integration branch.  The --no-rebuild form exists to
	suppress automatic rebuilding if the `integration.autorebuild`
	configuration variable is set.
+
If no branch name is specified then the current branch must be an existing
integration branch.

--add=<branch>::
	Appends a line `merge <branch>` to the instruction list, causing that
	branch to be included in the integration branch when it is next
	rebuilt.  This option may be specified multiple times to add multiple
	branches.

--continue::
	Restart the building process after having resolved a merge conflict.

--abort::
	Abort the rebuild operation and reset HEAD to the original branch.

--autocontinue::
--no-autocontinue::
	Continues automatically if the rerere mechanism manages to resolve all
	conflicts during a merge.

If `--continue` or `--abort` are specified then no other options may be given.
Otherwise at least one of `--create`, `--add`, `--edit` or `--rebuild` must be
specified.  If more than one is specified then they will be performed in the
order 'create', 'add', 'edit', 'rebuild'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

integration.autocontinue
	Sets the default for the `--autocontinue` option.

integration.autorebuild
	Automatically rebuild the integration branch after creating/editing it
	if --no-rebuild is not specified.

FORMAT OF INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
The instruction sheet consists of a series of instructions which begin in
column zero, each of which may be followed by indented comments.  The
following instructions are supported:

base '<ref>'::
	Resets the state of the integration branch to the specified revision.
	This should always be the first instruction in the instruction sheet,
	and should appear only at the top of the instruction sheet.

merge '<ref>'::
	Merges the specified ref into the integration branch.  Any comments
	following the instruction are appended to the merge commit's commit
	message.

Example
~~~~~~~
------
base master

merge my-experimental-feature

  I think this is a good idea, but want to dogfood it before I
  decide whether to submit it upstream.

merge my-site-specific-changes

  Some changes to suit my environment.  DO NOT SUBMIT THESE.
------

SHARING INSTRUCTION SHEETS
--------------------------
The instruction sheet is just another Git branch, except that it is under
'refs/insns/' and not 'refs/heads/'.  This means that they can be shared in
the same way as other branches.

For example, to push the instruction sheet for 'pu':

	git push origin refs/insns/pu
